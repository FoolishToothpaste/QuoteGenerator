Hello! This is my first project on Github. I made an HTML file that displays random quotes with an accompanying image with the click of a button.
Right now, there are only 10 quotes in the system. I plan to add more, and even enable a system where users can input their own quotes with accompanying images.
This is an extremely beginner friendly project, and if you're new to CSS / JS / HTML, definitely give it a try.
One major problem I'm facing is the format stability across various different screen sizes. This is because I'm using "px" to size the flex boxes instead of "vh" or "%". I don't know how to use them effectively yet.
